TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I struggled a lot with exercise 1 however I found exercise 3 and 4 a bit more intuitive to complete, although this was most likely to do with my progress through understanding exercise 1. For stobborn_asker, not_number_rejector and super_asker I spent many hours figuring out why nothing was returning, yet the tests were still passing. Running the code returned nothing in the terminal and debugging didn't find any issues, and I thought the logic was sound, so I assume it has something to do with returning for testing versus printing for the terminal, which is why I passed the tests but couldnt see the final outcome in the terminal. (please correct me if I am wrong)

I found exercise 3 and 4 quite opposite to my hellish experience in exercise 1. I enjoyed the debugging involved in these exercises as I learnt through every mistake. Exercise 4 was especially challenging as the previous exercises this week were input based and 4 went back to loop based and automation/algorithmic.
